<a id="what-am-i-doing" class="anchor" href="#what-am-i-doing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What am I doing?</h2>

<p>I really love games. 5 years ago I decided to shift my career and make video games.
I’ve spent the last few years making games for companies as well as making games
in my own free time. </p>

<p>I want to share my learnings and build a video game live.
It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a while and now committed to doing it. You can 
watch me code live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/skylerparr">https://www.twitch.tv/skylerparr</a>. You can also track my historic
progress on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/skylerparr">https://www.youtube.com/user/skylerparr</a> and see the progress of my 
code on <a href="https://github.com/skylerparr/LiveGame">https://github.com/skylerparr/LiveGame</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-vision" class="anchor" href="#the-vision" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Vision</h2>

<p>First and foremost, I want to share my joy and passion for making video games. I hope to influence
aspiring game developers, artists, game designers, and sound engineers. I want
everyone to feel they are a part of this process by asking questions, contributing 
to code, donating game art, suggesting game design changes and feature requests, and
contributing music and sound effects. I hope to make this game ours as a
community. Ideally this game is ours as a community.</p>

<p>My end goal is a successful game within the gaming community and I’m driving to have this
game stream and played, just as I streamed and built it.</p>

<a id="the-game" class="anchor" href="#the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Game</h2>

<h3>
<a id="the-lore" class="anchor" href="#the-lore" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The lore:</h3>

<p>The planet is dying, but there are pockets of life left. The only thing that has been passed
to the generations was religious practices of the arcane. A handful of highly evolved 
animals, called the Arcana, have mastered the art of resurrection and have become immortal.
They are able to channel the energy from the planet, and use that power to generate
new creatures from old souls to do their bidding. What do they do with this great power?
They wage direct war on the other Arcana to prove they are the most powerful in the
world. It’s time for you, as one of the Arcana, to prove you are the chosen one of the gods
and be the one to rule the planet.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-gameplay" class="anchor" href="#the-gameplay" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The gameplay:</h2>

<p>You are dropped into a battle arena vs other live players. Some enemies, some allies. 
It’s your goal to harvest the energy from the world to kill animals and other creatures, 
and collect their souls to build your army. When you feel you are powerful enough, you
attack your enemy’s base and destroy your opponent.</p>

<p>Each Arcana is different and throughout batter your will gain experience as you
destroy your enemy (or allies). As you gain levels, you will obtain better creatures
and stronger powers to destroy your enemy.</p>

<h2>
<a id="i-need-you" class="anchor" href="#i-need-you" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I need you!</h2>

<p>I need you to make this game a reality. I’m just a coder. I’ve targeted my knowledge to 
make games run fast and scalable. I’m not an artist, I’m not a sound
engineer, and I wouldn’t consider myself a top tier game designer. Making a game 
experience amazing includes great art, great sound, and great features.
That’s where you come in. Any donated content will either be implemented in the game
or posted on the game website with credit. This game is not mine. I want to make it ours. 
So I encourage you to join in, have fun, and feel like you’re a part of a community.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-you-can-contribute" class="anchor" href="#how-you-can-contribute" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How you can contribute</h2>

<p>For any art, sound, or content. Send me a pull request on github. If you don’t know how
or you’re uncomfortable with using github, message me on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/_wrongkiddied">https://twitter.com/_wrongkiddied</a>)
and I’ll help you out. For game design ideas; I will be creating a website at a later date when
we have a functional demo. I want the entire community to play and give feedback on 
any game aspect. </p>
