<p>I really love games. 5 years ago I decided to shift my career and make video games.
I spent the last few years making games for various companies and making games
on my own. I’ve decided I wanted to share my learnings and build a video game live.
It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a while and I’ve finally committed to it. You can 
watch me code live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/skylerparr">https://www.twitch.tv/skylerparr</a>. You can also track my historic
progress on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/skylerparr">https://www.youtube.com/user/skylerparr</a> and see the progress of my 
code on <a href="https://github.com/skylerparr/LiveGame">https://github.com/skylerparr/LiveGame</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-vision" class="anchor" href="#the-vision" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Vision</h2>

<p>I want to share my joy and passion for making video games. I hope to influence
aspiring game developers, artists, game designers, and sound engineers. I want
everyone to feel like they are a part of this process by asking questions, contributing 
to code, donating game art, suggesting game design changes and feature request, and
even contributing music and sound effects. I hope to make this game ours as a
community. I hope to make this game successful in the gaming community and 
I’m driving to have this game streamed and played, just as I streamed and built
it.</p>

<a id="the-game" class="anchor" href="#the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Game</h2>

<h3>
<a id="the-lore" class="anchor" href="#the-lore" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The lore:</h3>

<p>The planet is dying. There are pockets of life left. The only things that have been passed
to the generations was religious practices of the arcane. A handful of highly evolved 
animals, called the Arcana, have mastered the art of resurrection and have become immortal.
They are able to channel the energy from the planet, and use that power to generate
new creatures from old souls to do their bidding. What do they do with this great power?
They wage direct war on the other Arcana to prove they are the most powerful in the
world. It’s time for you, as one of the Arcana, to prove you are the chosen one of the gods
and to be the one to rule the planet.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-gameplay" class="anchor" href="#the-gameplay" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The gameplay:</h2>

<p>You are dropped into a battle arena vs other live players. Some enemies, some allies. 
It’s your goal to harvest the energy from the world to kill animals and other creatures, 
collect their souls to build your army. When you feel you are powerful enough, you
attack your enemy’s base and destroy your opponent.</p>

<p>Each Arcana is different and throughout batter your will gain experience as you
destroy your enemy (or allies). As you gain levels, you will obtain better creatures
and stronger powers to destroy your enemy.</p>

<h2>
<a id="i-need-you" class="anchor" href="#i-need-you" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I need you!</h2>

<p>I need you to make this game a reality. I’m just a coder. I’ve target my knowledge to 
make games run fast and be able to grow infinitely. I’m not an artist, I’m not a sound
engineer, I wouldn’t consider myself a top tier game designer. One of the key things
on making a game experience amazing is great art, great sound, and great features.
That’s where you come in. Any game content that is donated, I will either put it 
straight it into the game or post it on the website and give you credit. I don’t want to 
make this game mine. I want to make it ours. So I encourage you to join in,
have fun, and feel like you’re a part of a community.</p>

<a id="how-you-can-contribute" class="anchor" href="#how-you-can-contribute" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How you can contribute</h2>

<p>For any art, sound, or content. Send me a pull request on github. If you don’t know how
or you’re uncomfortable with using github, message me on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/_wrongkiddied">https://twitter.com/_wrongkiddied</a>)
and I’ll help you out. For game design ideas. I will be creating a website once I start
putting the game pieces into play and we have a functional demo. With game ideas, I 
want the community to be able to play them and give feedback. </p>
