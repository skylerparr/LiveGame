  "body": "## What am I doing?\r\nI really love games. 5 years ago I decided to shift my career and make video games.\r\nI spent the last few years making games for various companies and making games\r\non my own. I’ve decided I wanted to share my learnings and build a video game live.\r\nIt’s something I’ve wanted to do for a while and I’ve finally committed to it. You can \r\nwatch me code live on https://www.twitch.tv/skylerparr. You can also track my historic\r\nprogress on https://www.youtube.com/user/skylerparr and see the progress of my \r\ncode on https://github.com/skylerparr/LiveGame.\r\n\r\n## The Vision\r\nI want to share my joy and passion for making video games. I hope to influence\r\naspiring game developers, artists, game designers, and sound engineers. I want\r\neveryone to feel like they are a part of this process by asking questions, contributing \r\nto code, donating game art, suggesting game design changes and feature request, and\r\neven contributing music and sound effects. I hope to make this game ours as a\r\ncommunity. I hope to make this game successful in the gaming community and \r\nI’m driving to have this game streamed and played, just as I streamed and built\r\nit.\r\n\r\n## The Game\r\n### The lore:\r\nThe planet is dying. There are pockets of life left. The only things that have been passed\r\nto the generations was religious practices of the arcane. A handful of highly evolved \r\nanimals, called the Arcana, have mastered the art of resurrection and have become immortal.\r\nThey are able to channel the energy from the planet, and use that power to generate\r\nnew creatures from old souls to do their bidding. What do they do with this great power?\r\nThey wage direct war on the other Arcana to prove they are the most powerful in the\r\nworld. It’s time for you, as one of the Arcana, to prove you are the chosen one of the gods\r\nand to be the one to rule the planet.\r\n\r\n## The gameplay:\r\nYou are dropped into a battle arena vs other live players. Some enemies, some allies. \r\nIt’s your goal to harvest the energy from the world to kill animals and other creatures, \r\ncollect their souls to build your army. When you feel you are powerful enough, you\r\nattack your enemy’s base and destroy your opponent.\r\n\r\nEach Arcana is different and throughout batter your will gain experience as you\r\ndestroy your enemy (or allies). As you gain levels, you will obtain better creatures\r\nand stronger powers to destroy your enemy.\r\n\r\n## I need you!\r\nI need you to make this game a reality. I’m just a coder. I’ve target my knowledge to \r\nmake games run fast and be able to grow infinitely. I’m not an artist, I’m not a sound\r\nengineer, I wouldn’t consider myself a top tier game designer. One of the key things\r\non making a game experience amazing is great art, great sound, and great features.\r\nThat’s where you come in. Any game content that is donated, I will either put it \r\nstraight it into the game or post it on the website and give you credit. I don’t want to \r\nmake this game mine. I want to make it ours. So I encourage you to join in,\r\nhave fun, and feel like you’re a part of a community.\r\n\r\n## How you can contribute\r\nFor any art, sound, or content. Send me a pull request on github. If you don’t know how\r\nor you’re uncomfortable with using github, message me on twitter (https://twitter.com/_wrongkiddied)\r\nand I’ll help you out. For game design ideas. I will be creating a website once I start\r\nputting the game pieces into play and we have a functional demo. With game ideas, I \r\nwant the community to be able to play them and give feedback. \r\n\r\n# Let the games begin!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
