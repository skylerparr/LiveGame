You can \r\nwatch me code live on https://www.twitch.tv/skylerparr. You can also track my historic\r\nprogress on https://www.youtube.com/user/skylerparr and see the progress of my \r\ncode on https://github.com/skylerparr/LiveGame.\r\n\r\n## The Vision\r\nFirst and foremost, I want to share my joy and passion for making video games. I hope to influence\r\naspiring game developers, artists, game designers, and sound engineers. I want\r\neveryone to feel they are a part of this process by asking questions, contributing \r\nto code, donating game art, suggesting game design changes and feature requests, and\r\ncontributing music and sound effects. I hope to make this game ours as a\r\ncommunity. Ideally this game is ours as a community.\r\n\r\nMy end goal is a successful game within the gaming community and I’m driving to have this\r\ngame stream and played, just as I streamed and built it.\r\n\r\n## The Game\r\n### The lore:\r\nThe planet is dying, butt here are pockets of life left. The only thing that has been passed\r\nto the generations was religious practices of the arcane. A handful of highly evolved \r\nanimals, called the Arcana, have mastered the art of resurrection and have become immortal.\r\nThey are able to channel the energy from the planet, and use that power to generate\r\nnew creatures from old souls to do their bidding. What do they do with this great power?\r\nThey wage direct war on the other Arcana to prove they are the most powerful in the\r\nworld. It’s time for you, as one of the Arcana, to prove you are the chosen one of the gods\r\nand be the one to rule the planet.\r\n\r\n## The gameplay:\r\nYou are dropped into a battle arena vs other live players. Some enemies, some allies. \r\nIt’s your goal to harvest the energy from the world to kill animals and other creatures, \r\nand collect their souls to build your army. When you feel you are powerful enough, you\r\nattack your enemy’s base and destroy your opponent.\r\n\r\nEach Arcana is different and throughout batter your will gain experience as you\r\ndestroy your enemy (or allies). As you gain levels, you will obtain better creatures\r\nand stronger powers to destroy your enemy.\r\n\r\n## I need you!\r\nI need you to make this game a reality. I’m just a coder. I’ve targeted my knowledge to \r\nmake games run fast and scalable. I’m not an artist, I’m not a sound\r\nengineer, and I wouldn’t consider myself a top tier game designer. Making a game \r\nexperience amazing includes great art, great sound, and great features.\r\nThat’s where you come in. Any donated content will either be implemented in the game\r\nor posted on the game website with credit. This game is not mine. I want to make it ours. \r\nSo I encourage you to join in, have fun, and feel like you’re a part of a community.\r\n\r\n## How you can contribute\r\nFor any art, sound, or content. Send me a pull request on github. If you don’t know how\r\nor you’re uncomfortable with using github, message me on twitter (https://twitter.com/_wrongkiddied)\r\nand I’ll help you out. For game design ideas; I will be creating a website at a later date when\r\nwe have a functional demo. I want the entire community to play and give feedback on \r\nany game aspect. \r\n\r\n# Let the games begin!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
